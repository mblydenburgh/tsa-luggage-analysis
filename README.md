# tsa-luggage-analysis
An AngularJS application for analyzing TSA claim data.

Currently, app.js is written to handle a local specified excel file to retreive data from. The graphs are displaying static dummy data as manipulation/filtering of the imported JSON data is worked out. Data currently imports but monthly claim's totals for each airline are not implemented currently.

Graphing library Chart.js (via angular-chart.js)
